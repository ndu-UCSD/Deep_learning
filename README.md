# Deep learning Study guide

This document is my personal study note based on the first 3 courses of Andrew Ng's deep learning series on Coursera, containing lecture notes from 9 weeks' worth of workload. Below is a quick breakdown of the contents:

- Neural network and Deep learning
- Improve Deep neural network
- Structure you Machine Learning project
