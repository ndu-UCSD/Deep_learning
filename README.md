# Deep learning Study guide

This document is my personal study note based on the 5 courses of Andrew Ng's deep learning series on Coursera, containing lecture notes from 13+ weeks' worth of workload. Below is a quick breakdown of the contents:

- A. Neural network and Deep learning
- B. Improve Deep neural network
- C. Structure you Machine Learning project 
- D. Convolutional Neural Networks
- E. Sequence Models
